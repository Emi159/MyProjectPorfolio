												<h3>Real-time Data Analytics</h3>
												<p>In my recent project, I analyzed global wheat-trading datasets recorded daily, leveraging streaming data analytics to track vessel movements and back corrections in real time. My curiosity in streaming data analytics has deepened, especially after attending the webinar "How Live Commodity Data Adds Value," presented by the AXSMarine. This webinar illuminated how live shipping and commodity data enable swift, fact-based assessments and the use of indicators to support decision-making.</p>

											<h3>Occupational Health Analysis Mid-Year 2024</h3>
											<p>Topic: Data analysis| Occupational Health| Statistical Indicators </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python, PowerBI</p>
											<p>My most recent task involved producing a global sick leave statistical analysis for mid-year 2024. In this project, I collected data from multiple sources such as Workday, Cority, and internal data repositories. The data was globally integrated and cleaned using Python, with plans to automate the data cleaning process in the future. Once cleaned, the data was loaded into Power BI for visualization.

												To ensure comprehensive analysis, I conducted in-depth research on key occupational health statistical indicators. These included metrics such as the Employee Sick Leave Rate (ESLR), the Incidence Rate (IR), the Incident Severity Rate (ISR), and the Days Lost Per Injury Rate (DLPIR). I also considered other relevant statistical metrics to gain a holistic view.
												
												The primary goal of this project was to using the statistical indicators for comparison and assessment among different duty stations. This analysis helps identify patterns in sick leave usage, uncover trends in diagnoses (e.g., common causes for both short-term and long-term leave), and support informed decision-making in managing occupational health.
												
												Advanced DAX functions were employed to enhance the analysis, allowing for complex calculations and deeper insights into the data.</p>

											<h3>Real time data analysis
											</h3>
											<p>Topic: Real time data| Statistics| Economics </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python| SQL| DataBricks| Microsoft Azure| Power BI. </p>
											<p>This project focuses on monitoring real-time datasets to identify trading countries and ports with the highest frequency of back corrections, as well as the magnitude and direction of these adjustments. Using Azure Data Lake for data storage, the data is ingested into Databricks, where Python and SQL are employed to process, clean, and transform the raw data into meaningful insights. Once the data is processed, it is further refined and analyzed for trends, such as correction patterns and their impact on trade flows. The processed data is then connected to Power BI, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards that provide real-time visualizations of the trading corrections, allowing for actionable insights and enhanced decision-making for stakeholders. However, the dashboard is for internal enterprise use and is not available for external viewing.</p>

											<h3>Occupational Sick Leave Analysis in Turkey</h3>
											<p>Topic: Occupational Health| Statistics</p>
											<p>Technologies: Python| Power BI. </p>
											<p>This project analyzes sick leave (SL) data for 2024, focusing on the Ankara, Turkey duty station. The objective is to evaluate SL trends, including the breakdown of short-term and long-term cases, and identify the top diagnosis groups, which include digestive diseases, mental health, ENT, and traumatology. Key metrics such as the SL rate, days lost per injury, and the percentage of long-term SL cases (lasting over 30 days) are calculated to quantify the impact of absenteeism. By comparing SL data across duty stations, the project aims to highlight regional health-related trends and staffing challenges, providing actionable insights for workforce management.</p>

											<h3>Regional Trade Agreements Analysis</h3>
											<p>Topic: Statistics| Economics </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python </p>
											<p>For this project, I  work with data on regional trade agreements (RTAs) and bilateral trade
												flows. RTAs are legal texts negotiated and signed by countries or customs territories that regulate trade
												between them. They are binding agreements that establish preferential discriminatory trade regimes
												between two or more trading partners, not necessarily belonging to the same geographical region.
												All RTAs regulate trade in goods between the parties while some also regulate trade in services. The goal is to uncover key insights regarding the evolution and impact of RTAs over time, their types, and their effect on trade between countries.</p>

											<h3>Product reviews analysis</h3>
											<p>Topic: Text analysis| Natural Language Processing| Machine Learning </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python</p>
											<p>This project was implemented in collaboration with Effixis, a data science company specializing in NLP solutions. A large dataset of customer reviews is composed of textual customer reviews for given products and additional information such as product categories. Each review is accompanied by a customer rating of product satisfaction. This project utilizes various technologies, including Python and Natural Language Processing algorithms such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and pre-trained models, for sentiment analysis and machine learning.</p>

											<h3>A study about the power of Giacomini-White test in forecast evaluation, with an application to financial data</h3>
											<p>Topic: Finance| Statistics| Machine Learning </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python </p>
											<p>Forecasting is crucial in statistics and machine learning, enabling accurate predictions and informed decision-making based on historical data patterns. Evaluating forecasting methods involves two key approaches: point and interval forecasting. Point forecasts are assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics are also common in machine learning model evaluations, with lower scores typically indicating better performance. However, a lower metric score does not always guarantee a better model for the entire population. In this paper, I am going to focus on the use of the Giacomini-White (GW) test in comparing predictive ability between two competing forecasting models. This project combines time series analysis and advanced machine learning, utilizing forecasting evaluation, Python, R, statistical tests, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Sequential Learning Models.</p>

											<h3>Income Prediction</h3>
											<p>Topic: Finance| Statistics| Machine Learning </p>
											<p>Technologies: Python </p>
											<p>I achieved 1st rank in a Kaggle competition using data from the US Census Bureau, analyzing US residents who participated in the 2020-2021 survey. The goal was to predict income levels (high or low) based on demographic predictors. This forecasting task utilized ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost, and meta models. The final submission was a hard-max-vote ensemble. However, we recognized the methodological importance of using rigorous methods like cross-validation and noted that predictions from XGBoost, LGBM, or CatBoost, which had been cross-validated, would be more methodologically sound. However, we think that the voting ensemble is at least as strong as the individual learners that contribute to it.</p>
